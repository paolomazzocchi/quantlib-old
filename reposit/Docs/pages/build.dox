installing various configurations of reposit.

Here is the documentation for installing and running the binary release of

Below are various possibilities for compiling reposit from source code.  These
HOWTOs include instructions for building the object repository, the SWIG module
to autogenerate addin source code, and examples of all supported features.

is Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, also known as VC9.  32- and 64-bit builds are
supported.
